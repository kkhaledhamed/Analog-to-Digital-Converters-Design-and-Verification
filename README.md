## Introduction

The SAR ADC is a type of analog-to-digital converter that uses a binary search algorithm to approximate an input signal. This project implements and verifies a SAR ADC using behavioral modeling, digital logic design, and circuit simulations.

## Design Components

### Behavioral Models

- Inverter

- NAND Gate

- NOR Gate

- D Flip-Flop

### SAR Logic

- Comparator

- SAR Control Logic

- Capacitive DAC

- Transmission Gate

### SAR ADC Design

- Complete SAR ADC Circuit

- Final Testbench

## Verification

The design has been verified using functional tests and signal integrity analysis. The verification includes:

- DC Functional Test

- Sine Wave Test

## Performance Metrics

The system performance was evaluated using several key metrics:

- Effective Number of Bits (ENOB): 7.8 bits

- Signal-to-Noise and Distortion Ratio (SINAD): 56.4 dB

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): 49.5 dB

- Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR): 48.7 dB

- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): -56.4 dB

- Signal Power : -9 dB

## Software used:
- OCTAVE
- XSCHEM
